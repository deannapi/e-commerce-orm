## :bulb: Description
            AS A manager at an internet retail company
            I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
            SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

            GIVEN a functional Express.js API
            WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
            THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
            WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
            THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
            WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
            THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
            WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
            THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
            WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
            THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
